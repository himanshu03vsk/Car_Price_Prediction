This project involves the use of a regression model using the random forest algorithm to predict the price of used cars in India on the basis of difference in the 
year that the car was bought as to the current year, current market price, kilometers driven, type of fuel, type of sellers and transmission.
The model was made using Python and machine learning concepts.
The website was made using js,css,html and Flask for framework.

Instruction to launch model locally:

Step 1: Python and Flask should be installed in your device.
        "pip install Flask" - if flask is not installed.
Step 2: Open terminal/ command prompt:
Step 3: Using the console, navigate to the project folder using the cd command.( for eg: cd /Users/ankit/Downloads/Car_Price_Prediction-master-2/)
Step 4: for Linux/Mac run this code : export FLASK_APP=application.py
        for windows run this code : "set FLASK_APP=application.py"
Step 5:  Run the Flask application with:
         "flask run"
Step 6: The output prints out a confirmation message and the address.
        Copy and paste the address into the browser to see the project running.
        Now you can interact with the model.
